## Overview

Forward DNS queries on a VPS to `8.8.8.8` via **xray-core** `dokodemo-door`, and on the OpenWrt side use **tutuicmptunnel-kmod** to encapsulate UDP DNS queries into ICMP, reducing the chance of DPI interference and DNS poisoning. Use **iptables** to redirect inbound `53/UDP` to local `5353/UDP` to avoid conflicts with `systemd-resolved` occupying port 53.

## Topology & Approach

- Choose a Hong Kong VPS (EDNS-based routing is typically closer to mainland China, resulting in lower latency).
- On the VPS, run xray-core with a `dokodemo-door` inbound on `5353/UDP`, forwarding to `8.8.8.8:53`.
- On the VPS, use iptables to redirect `53/UDP` on `eth0` to `5353/UDP`.
- On OpenWrt, use `tutuicmptunnel-kmod` to encapsulate outbound DNS UDP traffic into ICMP and forward it, bypassing GFW DPI.
- Use a hotplug script to automatically create/remove the tunnel when the OpenWrt WAN interface goes up/down.
- Finally, configure the upstream DNS on OpenWrt to your VPS IP.

## VPS-Side Configuration

### xray-core Configuration

Add an inbound (`dokodemo-door`) on the server listening on `5353/UDP` and forwarding to `8.8.8.8:53`:

```json
{
  "port": 5353,
  "protocol": "dokodemo-door",
  "settings": {
    "address": "8.8.8.8",
    "port": 53,
    "network": "udp"
  },
  "tag": "dns-in"
}
```

> Notes
>
> - Port `5353` is used to avoid conflict with `systemd-resolved`, which occupies port `53`.
> - This inbound handles **UDP only**.

### Restart the service

```sh
sudo systemctl restart xray
```

## Port Redirection (iptables)

Redirect UDP/53 arriving on `eth0` to local UDP/5353. Insert the rule at the top to avoid being preempted by other rules:

```sh
sudo iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING 1 -i eth0 -p udp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 5353
```

Persist rules (Debian/Ubuntu):

```sh
sudo apt-get install -y iptables-persistent
sudo netfilter-persistent save
```

Verify:

```sh
sudo iptables -t nat -L -v -n
```

Test DNS resolution (from an external machine):

```sh
dig reddit.com @your_vps_ip
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, rcode: NOERROR, id: 44623
;; flags: qr rd ra ; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 4, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0

But don’t celebrate too early—at this point GFW DPI can still poison your results:

```sh
dig www.google.com @your_vps_ip

# OpenWrt-Side Configuration

## tutuicmptunnel-kmod and Hotplug Scripts

Use hotplug to create the tunnel on WAN up and clean it up on WAN down. The example below uses port 53—replace the variables with your real values.

`/etc/hotplug.d/iface/95-wan-up`

```sh
#!/bin/sh

[ "$ACTION" = "ifup" ] || exit 0
[ "$INTERFACE" = "wan" ] || exit 0

logger "Starting custom WAN script"

UID_=yourname-dns
HOST=x.x.x.x
PSK=yourpsk
PORT=53
# export TUTUICMPTUNNEL_PWHASH_MEMLIMIT=1024768  # adjust according to your tuserver settings

IP=$(curl -sf ip.3322.net)
echo local ip: $IP

V() {
  echo "$@"
  "$@"
}

ktuctl client-del $UID_ address $HOST
ktuctl client-add uid $UID_ address $HOST port $PORT comment your-vps-name-dns
echo "server-add uid $UID_ address $IP port $PORT comment yourname-dns" | V tuctl_client server $HOST server-port 14801 psk $PSK
```

`/etc/hotplug.d/iface/95-wan-down`

```sh
#!/bin/sh

[ "$ACTION" = "ifdown" ] || exit 0
[ "$INTERFACE" = "wan" ] || exit 0

logger "Stopping custom WAN script"

UID_=yourname-dns
HOST=x.x.x.x
PSK=yourpsk
PORT=53
COMMENT=yourname-dns
# export TUTUICMPTUNNEL_PWHASH_MEMLIMIT=1024768  # adjust according to your tuserver settings

V() {
  echo "$@"
  "$@"
}

ktuctl client-del uid $UID_ address $HOST
echo "server-del uid $UID_" | V tuctl_client server $HOST server-port 14801 psk $PSK
```

Add the corresponding UID on both server and client in `/etc/tutuicmptunnel/uids`, for example:

```text
116 yourname-dns
```

Notes:

- `UID_` identifies this tunnel instance and must match on both sides.
- `HOST` is your VPS public IP.
- `PSK` is the pre-shared key.
- Keep the `tuctl_client/ktuctl` commands and the management port `14801` consistent with your deployment.
- `tutuicmptunnel-kmod` performs UDP→ICMP conversion **before** netfilter, so it won’t conflict with iptables `REDIRECT`.
- Ensure OpenWrt and the VPS have synchronized time to avoid failures in key/session-based mechanisms.

## Testing and Enabling DNS

At this point you can run `ifdown wan; ifup wan` to enable `tutuicmptunnel-kmod` protection for UDP (converted to ICMP).

Check:

```sh
dig reddit.com @your_vps_ip
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, rcode: NOERROR, id: 44623
;; flags: qr rd ra ; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 4, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0
;; QUESTION SECTION:
;; reddit.com.    IN    A

;; ANSWER SECTION:
reddit.com.    192    IN    A    151.101.193.140
reddit.com.    192    IN    A    151.101.1.140
reddit.com.    192    IN    A    151.101.65.140
reddit.com.    192    IN    A    151.101.129.140

;; AUTHORITY SECTION:

;; ADDITIONAL SECTION:

;; Query time: 80 msec
;; SERVER: x.x.x.x
;; WHEN: Fri Oct 10 10:21:19 2025
;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 92
```

If you get four consistent IPs and they match global public resolution, poisoning is significantly mitigated. Then set the primary DNS in the network interface or DHCP/DNS settings to your VPS IP (`HOST`).

# Summary

- xray-core forwards DNS queries arriving at the VPS on `53/UDP` to a robust public DNS resolver.
- iptables redirects external `53/UDP` traffic to xray’s `5353/UDP` listener to avoid port conflicts.
- `tutuicmptunnel-kmod` converts DNS UDP queries into ICMP on OpenWrt, effectively reducing DPI-based poisoning.
- Hotplug scripts manage the tunnel automatically, yielding a stable workflow and improved DNS correctness
