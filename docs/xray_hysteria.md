## Overview

`xray-core` (since v26.2.6) supports `hysteria` outbound. This allows the client to connect to a Hysteria server directly through `xray-core`, while continuing to use `xray-core` for outbound management, routing, and traffic splitting.

This article assumes that the Hysteria server uses port `3323`. If you use a different port, replace the example port in the configurations below accordingly.

## Server configuration

The server side still uses **Hysteria server**, and the configuration method remains unchanged. Configure it as you normally would:

- Listen address / port
- TLS certificate
- Authentication token
- Congestion control parameters
- Bandwidth and policy limits

Make sure that:

- The actual UDP port listened on by the server matches the client configuration
- The firewall allows the corresponding UDP port
- The domain certificate matches `serverName`
- If relays, tunnels, or `tutuicmptunnel-kmod` are used, the forwarding target port is updated accordingly as well

You **must** set the following environment variable for the **Hysteria server**:

```sh
QUIC_GO_DISABLE_GSO=1
```

Otherwise, `tutuicmptunnel-kmod` will not work.

If you manage Hysteria with `systemd`, add the following to the service unit:

```ini
[Service]
Environment="QUIC_GO_DISABLE_GSO=1"
```

## xray-core client configuration

The client uses `xray-core` with a `hysteria` outbound. Example configuration:

```json
"outbounds": [
  {
    "tag": "proxy",
    "protocol": "hysteria",
    "settings": {
      "version": 2,
      "address": "your-server.example.com",
      "port": 3323
    },
    "streamSettings": {
      "network": "hysteria",
      "hysteriaSettings": {
        "version": 2,
        "auth": "your_auth_token",
        "congestion": "bbr"
      },
      "security": "tls",
      "tlsSettings": {
        "serverName": "your-server.example.com",
        "alpn": ["h3"]
      }
    }
  }
]
```

You **must** set the following environment variable for the **`xray-core` client**:

```sh
QUIC_GO_DISABLE_GSO=1
```

Otherwise, `tutuicmptunnel-kmod` will not work.

If you manage `xray-core` with `systemd`, add the following to the service unit:

```ini
[Service]
Environment="QUIC_GO_DISABLE_GSO=1"
```

## Configuration notes

- Use `hysteria` as the client protocol
- Keep both `settings.version` and `hysteriaSettings.version` set to `2`
- Use `"hysteria"` for `network`
- Use `"tls"` for `security`
- Use `["h3"]` for `alpn`
- The client and server ports must match
- Both server and client must set `QUIC_GO_DISABLE_GSO=1`

## `tutuicmptunnel-kmod` configuration

If you are still using `tutuicmptunnel-kmod` for link access, this part can remain mostly unchanged. You only need to update the target port to the actual Hysteria port you use.

First, check whether both server and client have a shared `/etc/tutuicmptunnel/uids` configuration:

```txt
123 your_user_name
```

Then verify that `tutuicmptunnel.ko` is loaded on both server and client, and that `ktuctl` can access the device:

```sh
sudo lsmod | grep tutuicmptunnel
sudo ktuctl -d
```

Run the following simple script on the client. It will sync the configuration to both the server and the client:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

V() {
  echo "$@"
  "$@"
}

TMP=$(mktemp)
export DEV=enp4s0 # your client uplink interface name

sudo ktuctl dump > "$TMP"
sudo rmmod tutuicmptunnel
sudo modprobe tutuicmptunnel

export TUTU_UID=your_user_name   # replace with the UID selected on the server
export ADDRESS=your-server.example.com # replace with your server domain or IP
export PORT=3323                 # Hysteria server UDP port

sudo ktuctl script - < "$TMP"
rm -f "$TMP"
sudo ktuctl load iface "$DEV"
sudo ktuctl client
sudo ktuctl client-del address "$ADDRESS" user "$TUTU_UID"
sudo ktuctl client-add address "$ADDRESS" port "$PORT" user "$TUTU_UID"

export COMMENT=your_client_name  # replace with a comment for this client
export HOST="$ADDRESS"
export PSK=your_psk_here         # replace with your tuctl_server PSK
export SERVER_PORT=14801         # replace with your tuctl_server port

# Uses a public IP query service to get the local public IP.
# You may replace it with another service if preferred.
IP=$(curl -sf ip.3322.net)
echo local ip: "$IP"

printf "server\nserver-add uid $TUTU_UID address $IP port $PORT comment $COMMENT\n" | V tuctl_client \
  psk "$PSK" \
  server "$HOST" \
  server-port "$SERVER_PORT"

# vim: set sw=2 ts=2 et:
```

If you use `systemd` to start `xray-core`, you can add both the environment variable and the pre-start script to the unit file:

```ini
[Service]
Environment="QUIC_GO_DISABLE_GSO=1"
ExecStartPre=/path/to/your/script.sh
```

You can run the script before starting the `xray-core` client. Alternatively, add it as `ExecStartPre` in the `systemd` unit so it runs automatically.

## Start at boot

Refer to your Hysteria deployment method. You can also continue using `crontab` or a `systemd-timer` to periodically run the script above, so that the configuration is updated automatically when the public IP changes.
